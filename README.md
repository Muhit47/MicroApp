# MicroApp

**[microapp website](https://mahi-bd.github.io/MicroApp/)** · **[download](https://github.com/Mahi-BD/MicroApp/releases/latest)** · [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) · [manual](HELP.md)

A small Windows tray tool that does a handful of things well:

- **Types the clipboard as real keystrokes** into any window — including ones that block paste (VM consoles, remote desktops, KVM/IPMI consoles, fields that refuse Ctrl+V). Handles every script, Bangla included.
- **Reads text off the screen with OCR** — drag over a browser, an image, a PDF, a video frame, anything.
- **Picks the exact text of any control** — like a colour picker, but for text (UI Automation, no OCR).
- **Captures a screen region as a PNG**, with an optional locked ratio or locked pixel size.
- **Records a screen region as an animated GIF.**
- **Records a screen region as an MP4 video with sound** (system, microphone, or both), no time limit, with pause/resume and live follow-the-pointer and zoom.
- **An image editor** — paste a screenshot, crop it, draw arrows and boxes, add styled text, blur the private parts, stamp logos from a reusable asset library, **remove a photo's background with one click** (offline AI) — all as Photoshop-style layers in **document tabs**, exported as one PNG/JPG or **printed** with a Photoshop-style preview.
- **Quick notes** — a hot key opens a fresh scratch-pad note that saves itself as you type, with spell check, **Bangla phonetic typing**, an **archive** for the ones you are done with, and an AI that fixes grammar or rewrites the note on request.
- **Optionally, the same notes on every PC** — mirrored through a free database **you** own, set up by a wizard. Off until you turn it on.

Everything runs offline. No account, no service, no telemetry. Text recognition uses the OCR engine built into Windows 10/11. The parts that can go online all live in Notes and are yours to enable: the AI buttons (Grammar, Ask AI, Bangla→English), which call the provider you configured with your own key when you click them; Bangla phonetic typing, which looks words up in the [string.bd](https://string.bd) dictionary with your own token; and note sync, which talks to a Firebase project created under your own Google account. There is no MicroApp server anywhere in that picture — nothing is hosted by this project, and your notes never pass through anyone else's account. The full privacy policy is in **[PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md)**.

## Install

**Installer** — download `MicroApp-5.2.0-setup.exe` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/Mahi-BD/MicroApp/releases/latest) and run it. The last page asks
whether MicroApp should **run when Windows starts**; tick it and it will. There is also a
`-peruser-setup.exe` that installs into your profile and needs no administrator rights.

**Portable** — or take `MicroApp-5.2.0-win-x64.zip`, unzip it anywhere and run `MicroApp.exe`. Nothing
is written outside your settings file.

Step-by-step instructions, silent-install switches, first-run setup for the AI and Bangla keys,
upgrading and uninstalling are all in **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)**.

Either way, MicroApp lives in the notification area — there is no main window. Right-click the tray icon
for everything: actions on top, settings below.

![Tray menu](docs/tray-menu.png)

Requires **Windows 10 (1809+) or Windows 11** and the **.NET Framework 4.8** runtime, which ships with both.

---

## The features

### 1. Paste as keystrokes

Copy some text, then either click the tray icon and click your target, or press the hot key
(**Ctrl+Alt+V** by default). The pointer becomes a crosshair; click where the text should land and
MicroApp types it there. Unicode scripts — Bangla, Hindi, Arabic, CJK — are typed correctly
regardless of the keyboard layout.

Three typing engines, because no single one works everywhere:

| Method | Use it when |
|---|---|
| `SendKeys` | Normal Windows apps. Fastest. |
| `AutoIt Send` | Odd keyboard layouts, some legacy apps. |
| `SendInput` (default) | VM consoles, remote desktops, anything that ignores the other two. |

Delays, a confirmation threshold for long pastes, and the hot key all live in **Key Setting**.

### 2. Grab text (OCR)

Press **Ctrl+Shift+O** (or tray → *Grab text (OCR)*), drag a box over any text on screen, and MicroApp
reads it.

The result can go straight to the clipboard, into a preview window you can edit first, or be typed
into the window you came from.

![OCR result](docs/ocr-result.png)

Recognition uses `Windows.Media.Ocr`. Whatever OCR language packs Windows has installed appear in the
language list — add more under *Windows Settings → Time & language → Language & region*.

### 3. Pick Text

Press **Ctrl+Alt+T** (or tray → *Pick Text*). A **+** crosshair with a live preview follows the
pointer; one click grabs the exact text of the control under it through UI Automation — no OCR,
character-perfect, however many lines. The click never reaches the app underneath, and password
fields are never read. Use OCR instead for images, videos and remote desktops.

![Pick Text](docs/pick-text.png)

### 4. Always on Top

Press **Ctrl+Alt+W** (or tray → *Always on Top*). The pointer turns into a **+** and the window under it is
outlined; click any window to keep it above all the others, and click a pinned window the same way to let it
go. **AOT Setting** sets how faded a pinned window is (opacity 20–100 %), puts a 📌 in its title, and has an
*Unpin all* button. Every window is given back as it was when MicroApp exits.

### 5. Screen capture

Press **Ctrl+Alt+S** (or tray → *Screen Capture*) and drag. The screen freezes and dims so the selection
is easy to see, and the dimming never ends up in the picture. Let go and the frame waits: drag it by
the middle to move it, pull a handle to resize it, nudge it with the arrow keys, then press **Enter**
(or the tick) to take the shot. GIF and video recording pick their region the same way.

![Capture overlay](docs/capture-overlay.png)

A **delay** can be set in Capture Setting (0 by default, i.e. straight away). With one, the frame stays
outlined and a badge counts the seconds down without taking the focus, so you can open a menu or a
tooltip first; the shot is then read fresh off the screen.

Two optional constraints:

- **Lock ratio** — dragging snaps to 16:9, 16:10, 8:5, 4:3, 1:1, 21:9 … (or any `W:H` you type).
- **Lock pixel size** — the box becomes an exact size, follows the pointer, and one click takes the shot.

Two buttons sit beside the tick: a **timer** (each click adds a second — the tick then starts the
countdown) and **Save As**, which writes the framed area straight to a PNG, JPEG or BMP.

The image goes to the clipboard, to a PNG, or both.

### 6. Record GIF

Press **Ctrl+Alt+G** (or tray → *Record GIF*), pick a region, and MicroApp records it. A small red badge
shows elapsed time, placed outside the recorded area so it stays out of the frames. Stop with **Esc**,
the hot key again, or by clicking the badge.

![Recording demo](docs/demo-recording.gif)

The toolbar stays outside the recorded area, so it never lands in the frames:

![Recording a region](docs/recording.png)

Frames stream straight to disk while recording, so a long capture costs no more memory than a short one.
GIF recording has its own hot key, frame rate, length limit, selection lock and output folder — separate
from screen capture.

### 7. Record Video

Press **Ctrl+Alt+R** (or tray → *Record Video*), pick a region, and MicroApp records it as a small
**MP4 (H.264 + AAC)** — with **sound** from the system, a microphone, or both mixed. A red frame marks
the recorded area and a badge shows the time, with live controls: **follow the mouse pointer**, **zoom**
50–400 % (the wheel works over the badge too), **mute the microphone**, **pause/resume** (paused stretches are
simply absent from the file) and **save**. There is no time limit: it records until you save, press **Esc**,
or press the hot key again. Encoding uses the codecs built into Windows; the video streams to disk while
it records.

### 8. Notes

Press **Ctrl+Shift+N** (or tray → *New Note*) and a fresh note opens in front of whatever you were
doing — every press gives a new one. A note is one window backed by one plain `.txt` file that
**saves itself as you type**; its title follows its first line. The toolbar strips spaces, joins
lines, inserts the date, long date or a timestamp in formats you choose, undoes and redoes
(**Ctrl+Z** / **Ctrl+Y**), and steps the text size with **A- / A+**. **Spell check** underlines
mistakes as you type (English, plus Bangla when a Bangla dictionary is installed) with right-click
suggestions. A **colour button** on the toolbar sets that note's colour — and whichever you pick last
is the colour new notes on that PC start in — while the last button **keeps the note above other
windows** while you copy out of it. The **All notes** browser
lists every note with a preview and has a **search box** across the top; click to select, click again to open.
Right-click a note to **pin** it to the top, **archive** it out of the way, give it a **colour** or
delete it — and **drag notes into whatever order you like**. Every note carries its own colour down
the left edge of its row. Notes stay off the taskbar by default so they never pile up there.

**The text is fixed-width**, like Notepad — paste a Markdown table or a log into a note and the
columns line up instead of drifting. Bangla still comes out in Nirmala UI wherever it appears, so a
mixed note stays readable; *Fixed-width text* in Note Setting turns it off again.

![All notes](docs/note-list.png)

**Archive what you are done with.** Archived notes leave the list and live in their own window —
the archive button on the notes toolbar. They sit newest first with the date and time on each row,
a search box in the top right filters by name **and** by what is written inside them, double-click
opens one, and **Unarchive** puts it back where it was. Nothing moves on disk: the `.txt` file stays
exactly where it was.

![Archive](docs/note-archive.png)

**Type Bangla by sound.** Click **E / ক** on the toolbar or press **Ctrl+Shift+L**, then type the way
the word sounds: `ami` → আমি, `bhalo` → ভালো. Suggestions appear under the word — **↑ ↓** to move,
**Enter**, **Tab** or **Space** to pick, **Esc** to dismiss. `.` becomes দাঁড়ি (।) and digits become
০–৯. English and Bangla sit at the same size in the same note, and you can switch back mid-sentence.

![Bangla phonetic typing](docs/note-bangla.png)

**Let the AI do the boring part.** The **Grammar** button fixes spelling and grammar in place. The
**Ask AI** box under the note takes an instruction — *rewrite this as a Facebook post*, *translate to
English*, *make it formal* — and applies it; **select some text first and only that part changes**.
Right-click any word to translate it: English words offer Bangla from the dictionary, Bangla words
offer English from the AI. Bring your own key: **MiMo, Gemini, ChatGPT or OpenRouter**, set in Note
Setting, and nothing is sent anywhere until you ask for it.

Bangla phonetic typing needs a free [string.bd](https://string.bd) API token, also set in Note Setting.

**Keep the same notes on every PC — if you want to.** Notes are ordinary `.txt` files on one PC by
default, and that mode needs no account, no network and no setup. *Set up sync* in Note Setting opens
a wizard whose first choice is *Just this PC*; the other two mirror your notes to a database instead.

The database is **a Firebase project you create under your own Google account** — free (Spark plan,
no card), and nothing ships inside MicroApp. The wizard walks the first PC through making one: it
copies the security rules to your clipboard and opens the Firebase console for you. **You never
invent an email address or a password** — MicroApp makes its own sign-in inside your project and
hands you a **sync code**. Every PC after that pastes that one code and is done.

Pins, archive flags, colours and the drag order travel with the notes, a note deleted on one PC is
deleted on the others, and the newer copy always wins — judged on the database's clock, so a PC with
the wrong time set cannot overwrite everyone else. It is close to realtime: a change is up about
three seconds later and on the other PCs within about fifteen. *Disconnect* puts everything back to
local-only at any time, leaving every note where it is.

![Set up sync](docs/note-sync.png)

### 9. Image Editor

Press **Ctrl+Alt+E** (or tray → *Image Editor*) and paste any image — the window opens on whatever
is on the clipboard. It is laid out like Photoshop, and it answers to Photoshop's keys, menus and
right-click menus (**Help → Keyboard Shortcuts** lists them all).

![The image editor](docs/editor.png)

- **Documents in tabs.** Keep several images open, each in its own tab with its own layers,
  history and zoom (**Ctrl+Tab** switches, **Ctrl+W** closes). **File → New** opens a Photoshop-style
  preset window — **Print** (A0–A6, B4, B5, Letter, Legal, Tabloid), **Ratio** (16:9, 21:9, 4:3, 1:1,
  9:16…), **Photo**, **Web**, **Mobile**, **Film & Video**, plus your recent sizes — with units
  (px / in / cm / mm / pt), resolution, orientation and background. **File → Open** opens a picture
  in a new tab; **File → Add Image** adds it to the current one as a layer.
- **Remove Background.** One click (the button under the tools, or **Alt+Ctrl+B**) makes everything
  but the subject transparent, like remove.bg — an AI model (IS-Net) that ships with MicroApp and
  runs offline on your PC in a second or two. With a selection, only the part inside it is changed.
  **Remove Background (Fast)** uses a smaller model for a quicker, rougher cut.
- **Layers.** Every paste, mark, text box and asset is its own layer, with blend modes, opacity,
  a lock, drag-to-reorder, merge down / merge visible / flatten, and **Layer Styles** — drop
  shadow, outer glow, stroke, colour overlay. A **History** panel jumps back fifty steps.
- **Selections.** Rectangular and elliptical marquee, lasso, polygonal lasso and magic wand,
  with add / subtract / intersect, feather, expand, contract, border, smooth, inverse, grow and
  similar. Delete, fill, stroke, copy, cut, layer-via-copy, crop and every filter respect it.
- **Free Transform (Ctrl+T).** Scale, rotate, skew, distort and perspective with Photoshop's
  modifiers, exact numeric entry, Enter to commit.
- **Painting.** Brush, pencil, eraser, clone stamp, gradient, paint bucket, blur, sharpen,
  dodge, burn and an eyedropper, with size / hardness / opacity / flow and the `[` `]` keys.
- **Adjustments and filters.** Levels, Curves, Brightness/Contrast, Exposure, Vibrance,
  Hue/Saturation, Color Balance, Black & White, Photo Filter, Invert, Posterize, Threshold,
  Desaturate, Equalize, Auto Tone / Contrast / Color; Gaussian / motion / box blur, unsharp
  mask, noise, median, mosaic, emboss, find edges, solarize, high pass, vignette — all with a
  live preview.
- **Shapes and text.** Rectangle, rounded rectangle, ellipse, polygon, line, arrow and a
  freehand pencil, each with stroke, width and fill; text with font, size, style, alignment,
  colour, box and outline — all editable later, all transformable.
- **Crop and canvas.** Crop with handles and ratio presets, Image Size, Canvas Size with an
  anchor, Trim, Reveal All, rotate and flip the canvas.
- **Asset library.** Keep logos, stamps and PNG/vector art organised in categories and
  sub-categories (a folder tree under `%AppData%\MicroApp\Assets`). Double-click any asset to
  drop it in as a layer, and save any layer back into the library.
- **Out again.** File → Save As (PNG keeps transparency, JPG for mail, BMP, TIFF),
  **Shift+Ctrl+C** to put the finished image — or just the selected part — on the clipboard, or
  **File → Print** (**Ctrl+P**): a Photoshop-style print window that previews the page to scale
  (drag the picture to place it), with printer, copies, paper, orientation, centring, scale to fit,
  exact size in in / cm / mm and a warning when the print resolution is too low.

## Default hot keys

| Action | Hot key |
|---|---|
| Paste as keystrokes | `Ctrl + Alt + V` |
| Grab text (OCR) | `Ctrl + Shift + O` |
| Pick Text | `Ctrl + Alt + T` |
| Always on Top | `Ctrl + Alt + W` |
| Screen capture | `Ctrl + Alt + S` |
| Record GIF | `Ctrl + Alt + G` |
| Record Video | `Ctrl + Alt + R` |
| New note | `Ctrl + Shift + N` |
| Image editor | `Ctrl + Alt + E` |
| Type the date | `Ctrl + Shift + D` |
| Type the long date | `Ctrl + Shift + M` |
| Bangla / English in a note | `Ctrl + Shift + L` |
| Cancel anything in progress | `Esc` |

![Shortcuts](docs/shortcuts.png)

Hot keys act the moment the combination is pressed — the crosshair appears while the keys are still held.

Global hot keys win over the focused app, so if one collides with something you use, change it — every
hot key is editable in its settings window, or all of them together under tray → **Shortcuts**, and
clearing the key box disables that hot key entirely. **Ctrl+Shift+D / Ctrl+Shift+M** type the current
date (short / long form) into the focused window; their formats live on the Shortcuts window too.
