## Getting started

Installing, silent-install switches, upgrading and uninstalling are covered separately in
**[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)**.

MicroApp runs in the notification area. There is no main window and nothing to log into.

- **Left-click** the tray icon → start a paste (pick a target, then click it).
- **Right-click** the tray icon → the menu:

```

```

Global hot keys act the moment the combination is pressed — the crosshair appears while the keys
are still held down.

MicroApp's windows are laid out in fixed pixels and scale as a whole, so they stay correct at any
Windows display scaling (100%, 125%, 150%, …), while capture, OCR and the recording overlays keep
working in true screen pixels.

Only one copy runs at a time. Starting a second one exits silently.

Notifications appear bottom-right for about a second and never take focus. Click one to dismiss it early.

## Paste as keystrokes

Some windows refuse a normal paste: VM consoles, remote desktop sessions, KVM/IPMI consoles, "no paste"
password fields. MicroApp types the clipboard character by character instead, so those windows see
ordinary typing. Text in any script is typed correctly — characters the keyboard layout cannot produce
(Bangla, Hindi, Arabic, CJK, …) are injected directly as Unicode. The one exception is hardware
VM/IPMI consoles that ignore Unicode input; those can only receive what their own layout can express.

**How to use it**

1. Copy text anywhere.
2. Click the tray icon, or press **Ctrl+Alt+V**.
3. The pointer turns into a crosshair. Click the window you want it typed into.
4. Press **Esc** at any time to stop typing.

**Typing method** (Typing Setting)

| Method | Notes |
|---|---|
| `SendKeys` | The classic Windows path. Fastest, but some apps ignore it. |
| `AutoIt Send` | Handles more keyboard layouts. |
| `SendInput` | Scan codes with an ALT-numpad fallback. Works in VM consoles. **Default.** |

**Delays** — *milliseconds before typing starts* gives the target window time to take focus;
*milliseconds between keystrokes* slows typing down for apps that drop fast input. If characters go
missing, raise the between-keystrokes delay first.

**Safety** — tick *Ask me first when pasting more than N keystrokes* to get a confirmation before a long
paste. The dialog names the target window, so you can back out if you clicked the wrong one.

**Hot key mode** — the hot key can either put you in target-picking mode ("Let me click a target") or
start typing into the current window immediately ("Start typing right away").

## Grab text (OCR)

Reads text off the screen: a browser, a scanned PDF, an image, a paused video, a remote desktop, an
error dialog that won't let you select text.

**How to use it**

1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+O**, or tray → *Grab text (OCR)*.
2. The screen freezes and dims, and the pointer becomes a crosshair.
3. Drag over the text. **Esc** or a right-click cancels.
4. The text is delivered per your OCR Setting.

**After capture** options:

- **Copy it to the clipboard** *(default)* — a toast confirms how many characters were copied.
- **Show it in a window first** — an editable preview with **Copy** and **Type it out**.
- **Type it straight into the window I was using** — focus returns to where you were, then it types.

**Keep the original line breaks** — on by default. Turn it off to flow the result into one paragraph,
which is what you usually want when lifting a sentence out of a wrapped column (hyphenated line ends
are rejoined).

**Language** — the list shows the OCR packs Windows has installed. "Use my Windows languages" follows
your Windows language order. To add a language: *Windows Settings → Time & language → Language & region
→ Add a language*, then check that its optional **Optical character recognition** feature is installed.

Small selections are upscaled before recognition, so grabbing a short line of small text still works.

---

## Pick Text

Grabs the **exact** text of a control — like a colour picker, but for text. No OCR: it asks the
control itself (through Windows UI Automation), so the result is character-perfect and keeps every
line, however long the text is. Works on labels, edit boxes, lists, buttons, message bodies — anything
that exposes its text to Windows. Password fields are never read.

**How to use it**

1. Press **Ctrl+Alt+T**, or tray → *Pick Text*.
2. The pointer becomes a **+** crosshair. As you move, the element under it is outlined and a small
   card previews the text it holds.
3. **Click** to take that text. **Esc** or a right-click cancels; the click never reaches the app
   underneath, so you won't accidentally press what you're picking from.
4. The text is delivered per your OCR Setting: clipboard *(default)*, preview window, or typed out.

If the element you click carries no text of its own, MicroApp gathers the texts of everything inside
it (one line each) — handy for lifting a whole list or dialog at once. Prefer *Grab text (OCR)* for
images, videos and remote desktops, where there is no real text behind the pixels.

---

## Always on Top

Keeps any window above all the others — a video, a calculator, a chat, a note.

**How to use it**

1. Press **Ctrl+Alt+W**, or tray → *Always on Top*.
2. The pointer becomes a **+** crosshair and the window under it is outlined.
3. **Click** a window to pin it on top. Click a pinned window the same way to let it go. **Esc**, a
   right-click or the hot key again cancels. The click only picks the window — the app never receives it.

**AOT Setting** (tray):

| Setting | Default |
|---|---|
| Always on Top hot key | `Ctrl + Alt + W` |
| Opacity of a pinned window | 100 % (20–100 %) |
| Clicking a pinned window again takes it off the top | on |
| Put a 📌 in the title of a pinned window | on |
| Show a notification on pin / unpin | on |
| Play a sound on pin / unpin | off |

*Right now* shows how many windows are pinned, with **Unpin all**. MicroApp gives every window back —
on top or not, opacity and title — when it exits. Windows of an app running as administrator can only
be pinned when MicroApp runs as administrator too; MicroApp says so when that happens.

## Screen capture

**How to use it**

1. Press **Ctrl+Alt+S**, or tray → *Screen Capture*.
2. Drag over the area. The size badge shows the exact pixel dimensions as you drag.
3. Let go and the frame stays put so you can get it right:
   - **drag inside it** to move the whole frame — a four-way arrow appears in the middle while the
     pointer is over it,
   - **drag a handle** — the corners, and the edge middles once the frame is big enough — to resize it,
   - **arrow keys** nudge it a pixel at a time, **Ctrl+arrows** ten, **Shift+arrows** resize instead,
   - drag anywhere outside to start over.
4. **Enter**, a double-click inside the frame, or the tick button takes the shot.
5. **Esc**, a right-click, the cross button, or a click without dragging cancels.

Two more buttons sit to the left of the tick:

- **Timer** (or **T**) — each click adds a second: 1 click = 1 s, 2 clicks = 2 s … up to 10, then back to
  1. The number shows on the button. The tick (or Enter) then starts the countdown; with no timer set the
  tick takes the shot at once. The timer wins over the Capture Setting delay for that one shot.
- **Save As** (or **Ctrl+S**) — saves the framed area straight to a PNG, JPEG or BMP of your choosing.
  Cancel the dialog and the frame stays where it was.

**Delay** (Capture Setting) — *seconds before it grabs*, 0 by default, which takes the shot the moment
you confirm the frame. Set it to a few seconds and the picker gets out of the way instead: the frame
stays outlined, a badge counts down beside it, and you have that long to open the menu, tooltip or
hover state you are trying to photograph. Neither the outline nor the badge takes the focus — so the
menu you open stays open — and both are gone before the picture is taken. Click the badge to call it
off. Unlike an immediate capture, which uses the frozen copy made when the picker opened, a delayed
one reads the screen fresh at the end of the count, which is the whole point.

**Selection lock** (Capture Setting):

- **Lock ratio** — the box snaps to the chosen shape while you drag: 16:9, 16:10, 8:5, 4:3, 3:2, 1:1,
  21:9, 9:16, 3:4, or any `W:H` you type. The size stays up to you, and the shape survives every later
  move and resize.
- **Lock pixel size** — the box is exactly the width and height you set, follows the pointer, and a
  single click takes the shot. This overrides lock ratio (a fixed size already fixes the shape), and
  there is nothing to adjust afterwards.

**After capture** — copy the image to the clipboard, save it as a PNG, or both.

Because the picker works on a frozen copy of the screen, the dimmed overlay never appears in the result,
and nothing on screen can move between aiming and capturing.

---

## Record GIF

**How to use it**

1. Press **Ctrl+Alt+G**, or tray → *Record GIF*.
2. Pick the region (same crosshair, same locks — GIF has its own lock settings). Adjust the frame
   the same way as a screen capture — move it, resize it from the handles — and press **Enter** or
   the tick to start.
3. Recording starts. A red **REC 3.2s / 10s** badge appears just outside the recorded area.
4. Stop with **Esc**, by pressing the hot key again, by clicking the badge, or by letting the time
   limit expire.

**Recording** (GIF Setting) — frame rate 1–30 fps (10 by default) and a maximum length in seconds
(10 by default). Higher fps means smoother playback and a bigger file.

**After capture** — the GIF file is always written; you can additionally have the path copied to the
clipboard, or have the file opened in your default viewer.

The mouse pointer is drawn into the frames, since screen copies leave it out.

---

## Record Video

Like Record GIF, but the result is a small **MP4 (H.264 + AAC)** — a minute of screen costs
megabytes rather than the hundreds a GIF would — and it can include **sound**.

**How to use it**

1. Press **Ctrl+Alt+R**, or tray → *Record Video*.
2. Pick the region (same crosshair, same locks — video has its own lock settings). Adjust the frame
   the same way as a screen capture — move it, resize it from the handles — and press **Enter** or
   the tick to start.
3. Recording starts, with a red **REC** badge outside the recorded area. The badge has, left to right:
   - **Follow the pointer** (the target): the recorded area glides after the mouse, smoothly and within
     the screens, so a small video can follow what you are doing on a big screen. Click again and it glides back.
   - **Zoom − / +** (or scroll the mouse wheel over the badge; click the percentage for 100 %): from 50 %
     to 400 %. The video keeps its size - zooming in records a smaller area enlarged, zooming out a
     bigger area reduced. Together with Follow this gives a close-up that tracks the pointer.
   - **Microphone** (when your voice is being recorded): mute and unmute it live.
   - **Pause/resume** (or **Ctrl+Alt+P** from anywhere) — paused stretches are left out of the file
     entirely — and **save**, which stops the recording and keeps the MP4.

   Drag the badge by any empty spot to move it out of the way.
4. Recording has **no time limit**: it runs until you save it, press **Esc**, or press the hot
   key again.

**Recording** (Video Setting) — frame rate 1–30 fps (20 by default), a **quality** choice (*Small file* / *Balanced* / *Sharp*) that trades file size
against picture crispness, and a **sound** source: *No sound*, *System sound* (whatever the machine
is playing), *Microphone*, or *System sound + microphone* (both mixed into one track - your voice over
whatever is playing).

**While recording** (Video Setting):
- **Keep the mouse pointer its normal size when zoomed**: on by default. Turn it off and the pointer is
  enlarged or reduced together with the picture.
- **Show a glow on mouse clicks**: every click leaves a short expanding ring in the video (yellow for the
  left button, blue for the right, green for the middle). This makes it easy to follow in a tutorial.
- **Write an action log**: a `.txt` file with the same name as the video, in the same folder, lists each
  mouse click and key press with the second of the video it happens at, for example
  `00:12.4  Left click at 400, 225`, `00:15.0  Typed "hello"`, `00:16.2  Key Ctrl+S`. Paused stretches are
  skipped, so the times match the video. Everything you type is written to it, **passwords included**,
  so leave it off when you record a login.

Encoding uses the H.264 and AAC encoders built into Windows — nothing extra is installed, and the
video streams to disk while it records. If no audio device is available the recording is silently
made without a sound track. On Windows *N* editions the Media Feature Pack must be installed.

**After recording** — the MP4 is always written (to `Videos\MicroApp` unless you pick another
folder); you can additionally have the path copied or the file opened in your default player.

While recording, a thin **red frame** marks the recorded area (grey while paused) and moves with it
when following or zooming. It is click-through, and both the frame and the badge are hidden from
screen capture (Windows 10 2004 or later), so neither appears in the video.

## Notes

A scratch pad that is always one hot key away. Every press of **Ctrl+Shift+N** (or tray → *New
Note*) opens a **fresh** note — older ones come back through the note list.

A new note opens **in front** of whatever you were working in.

Each note is one window backed by one plain `.txt` file. There is no save button: the file follows
your typing with less than a second of lag. Close the window and the note is on disk; close an empty
note and its file is removed. The window title always shows the note's first line. Note windows stay
**off the taskbar** by default (a switch in Note Setting brings them back).

The text is **fixed-width**, the way Notepad is: every character takes the same space, so a pasted
Markdown table, a log or a block of code lines up column for column instead of drifting. Bangla is
drawn in **Nirmala UI** wherever it appears, since no fixed-width face carries Bengali — a note that
mixes the two keeps its English lined up and its Bangla properly joined. Turn *Fixed-width text* off
in Note Setting to put the whole note back in Nirmala UI. **A-** and **A+** on the toolbar step the
size between 8 and 28 pt; the choice is remembered and applies to every open note at once.

**The toolbar** — new note · all notes · remove every space · join all lines · insert date · insert
long date · insert timestamp · **undo** · **redo** · **A-** · **A+** · **E / ক** (Bangla) ·
**Grammar** · settings. The three date/time formats are configurable in Note Setting, each with a
live preview. Undo and redo also answer to **Ctrl+Z** and **Ctrl+Y**.

**Spell check** — misspellings get a red squiggle as you pause typing, using the spell checker built
into Windows. English is always checked; Bangla words are checked only when a Bangla dictionary is
installed, and are never sent to the English checker. Right-click a squiggled word for suggestions
and *Add to dictionary*.

**Bangla phonetic typing** — click **E / ক** on the toolbar or press **Ctrl+Shift+L**, and type
Bangla the way it sounds. A list of candidates appears under the word as you type: `ami` → আমি,
`bhalo` → ভালো, `bangla` → বাংলা.

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` | move through the candidates |
| `Enter` or `Tab` | take the highlighted one |
| `Space` | take the highlighted one and type the space |
| `Esc` | dismiss the list (a second `Esc` closes the note) |
| `.` | types দাঁড়ি (।) |
| `0`–`9` | type ০–৯ |

Typing punctuation or any other separator also accepts the highlighted candidate, so ordinary typing
just works. Press **Ctrl+Shift+L** again for English — you can switch mid-sentence.

This looks words up in the **[string.bd](https://string.bd)** dictionary, so it needs an API token
(free from string.bd) in Note Setting. Lookups are cached, so repeated words convert instantly even
when you type quickly.

![Bangla phonetic typing](docs/note-bangla.png)

**Grammar (AI)** — one click sends the note to the AI service you configured and replaces the text
with the corrected version (English, Bangla or mixed — the language is preserved). Four providers:
**MiMo**, **Gemini**, **ChatGPT**, **OpenRouter**. Each needs your own API key, set in Note Setting;
for MiMo the base URL is also configurable (Token Plan subscriptions get a regional URL from the MiMo
console). Nothing ever leaves your machine unless you press the button.

**Ask AI** — the box under the note takes an instruction in plain words and applies it to the note:
*rewrite this as a Facebook post*, *translate to English*, *make it shorter*, *turn this into bullet
points*. Press Enter or click the send button.

**Select text before you ask and only that part is rewritten** — the rest of the note is left exactly
as it was, and the new text stays selected so you can refine it again.

**Translate a word** — right-click any word for its translation: an **English** word offers Bangla
from the string.bd dictionary, a **Bangla** word offers English from your AI provider. Pick one and it
replaces the word. Right-clicking inside a selection translates the whole selection instead of one
word.

**All notes** (toolbar list button) — every note with a first-line preview and a slim scrollbar.
**Click** a note to select it, **click it again** (or press Enter, or double-click) to open it. The
footer has *New note*, two icon buttons — **close all open notes** and **delete all notes** — and
*Delete* / *Open* for the selected one. The window remembers its size and position.

Each note carries its **own colour**, shown as a bar down the left of its row with a matching tint.
The colour is picked automatically so a full list is easy to scan; *Colour* on the right-click menu
sets a specific one (eight to choose from) or puts it back to *Automatic*. The **colour button on the
note's own toolbar** does the same from inside the note, and shows the colour that note is wearing.

Whichever colour you pick last becomes the colour **new notes on this PC start in**. That is a setting
on this machine rather than part of a note, so it is not synced and each PC can differ; *Automatic*
goes back to picking a colour from the note's name.

**Search** with the box across the top of the list: it matches a note's file name and its title — the
first line, which is the bold text on its row. (The Archive's box additionally searches inside notes.)

**Right-click a note** for:

| Item | Does |
|---|---|
| **Open** | Same as double-clicking it |
| **Pin to top** | Keeps the note at the top of the list, with a pin marker, whatever the order |
| **Archive** | Takes the note out of the list, without deleting it, and puts it in the Archive window |
| **Colour** | Picks the note's colour, or *Automatic* |
| **Delete** | Deletes that note |
| **Archive…** | Opens the Archive window |

#### The Archive

Archived notes leave the main list and live in their own window — the **archive button** in the notes
toolbar, or *Archive…* on the right-click menu. They are listed **newest first** by the time each was
last written, with the date and time on every row.

- **Search** — the box in the top right filters as you type, matching both the note's name and
  everything written inside it.
- **Double-click** a row (or *Open*) to open the note as usual; it stays archived.
- **Unarchive** — the button, or the right-click item, puts a note back in the main list with the
  colour and place it had before.
- **Delete** works the same as in the main list.

Archiving changes nothing on disk: the `.txt` file stays exactly where it was, and *archived* is one
flag in `.notes-meta`.

**Drag to reorder** — grab any row and drag it up or down; an accent line shows where it will land.
The order you build is remembered between sessions, pinned notes always float above the rest, and a
brand-new note still arrives at the top. (The Archive is always in date order, so rows there do not
drag.)

Pins, archive flags, colours and the manual order are kept in a small `.notes-meta` file inside the
notes folder, each with the time it last changed so sync can tell a fresh setting from a stale one. The notes themselves stay plain `.txt` files — delete `.notes-meta` and you only lose
the decoration, never a note.

---

## Image Editor

Tray → **Image Editor**, or **Ctrl+Alt+E**. The window opens on whatever image is on the
clipboard; with nothing there, paste later (**Ctrl+V**), drop a file onto the window, or start
blank with **File → New** (**Ctrl+N**). The layout follows Photoshop: a two-column tool rail on
the left with the foreground/background colours under it, an options bar under the menu that
changes with the tool, the canvas in the middle, and **Layers / History** plus the **Assets**
library on the right (drag the handle beside them to make the panels wider or narrower; the
editor remembers it, along with its window size). Every tool answers to Photoshop's key, every menu command to Photoshop's
shortcut, and right-clicking the canvas or a layer opens the menu you would expect there.
**Help → Keyboard Shortcuts** lists them all.

### Documents and tabs

Several images can be open at once, each in its own **tab** above the canvas, as in Photoshop.
Every tab keeps its own layers, history, selection and zoom. Click a tab to switch
(**Ctrl+Tab** / **Ctrl+Shift+Tab** cycle through them, and the **Window** menu lists them all).
Click its **×** or middle-click it to close it (**Ctrl+W**). Right-click a tab for **Close Others** / **Close
All**. A **\*** after the name means the document has changes that were not saved.

**File → New** (**Ctrl+N**, or the **+** at the end of the tabs) opens the **New Document**
window. Pick a preset from **Recent** (the clipboard's size, the current document's and the
sizes you made last), **Print** (A0-A6, B4, B5, Letter, Legal, Tabloid…), **Ratio** (16:9, 21:9,
4:3, 1:1, 3:2, 9:16…), **Photo**, **Web**, **Mobile** or **Film & Video**. You can also type a size in
pixels, inches, centimetres, millimetres or points at any resolution. **Constrain** keeps
the ratio while you type; the orientation buttons swap portrait and landscape. **Create**
(or double-clicking a preset) opens the new document in a new tab. The open ones stay as
they are.

**File → Open** (**Ctrl+O**) opens each picture in a tab of its own. **File → Add Image**
(**Shift+Ctrl+O**) puts pictures into the current document as new layers instead. **File → Exit**
(**Ctrl+Q**) closes the editor.

### Printing

**File → Print** (**Ctrl+P**) opens a print window like Photoshop's, so you see the page before anything
is printed. The page is drawn to scale on the left with the picture on it (the dashed line is the
area the printer can reach); drag the picture to move it. On the right pick the **printer**,
**copies**, **paper** and **portrait / landscape** (**Printer Settings…** opens the printer's own
options), then place the picture: **Center**, or type **Top / Left**, and size it with
**Scale to Fit Media**, a **Scale** %, or a **Width / Height** in inches, centimetres or millimetres.
At 100 % a document prints at its real size - an A4 made at 300 ppi comes out as A4. The window shows
the resulting print resolution and warns under 150 PPI or when part of the picture falls outside
the printable area. Nothing is sent until you press **Print**.

### Selecting several layers

As in Photoshop, several layers can be selected at once:
- **Layers panel**: **Ctrl+click** adds or removes a layer, and **Shift+click** selects every layer between the current one and the one clicked.
- **Canvas**: with the Move tool, **Shift+click** an object to add it (or take it out again).
- **Select → All Layers** (**Alt+Ctrl+A**) selects every visible, unlocked layer.

Then:
- **Drag** any of them and they all move together. They snap to guides; hold Ctrl to place freely.
- The **arrow keys** nudge all of them.
- **Delete** removes all of them in one undo step.
- The **align** buttons in the options bar line them up with each other, not with the canvas.
- The **distribute** buttons (after the align buttons, or **Layer → Distribute Horizontally / Vertically**) space three
  or more layers evenly. The outermost two stay put and the others move so every gap is the same.

A plain click on another layer goes back to one layer.

### Rulers and guides

The **ruler button** under the tools (next to Remove Background), **View → Rulers** or **Ctrl+R** shows the rulers.
As in Photoshop:
- **Add a guide**: drag down out of the top ruler for a horizontal guide, or right out of the left ruler for a
  vertical one. The position shows next to the pointer while you drag. **Shift** snaps it to the ruler's ticks.
- **Move a guide**: drag it with the Move tool, or with any other tool while holding **Ctrl**.
- **Delete a guide**: drag it back onto a ruler.
- **Right-click a guide** to lock or unlock it (a locked guide is dashed and cannot be dragged), delete it,
  change its colour, give every guide that colour, lock all guides, turn snapping on or off, or clear them all.
- **Snapping**: while you move a layer or a selection, or draw a marquee, a shape or a crop, edges and centres
  snap to a guide within a few pixels. Hold **Ctrl** while moving to place freely.
- **View** menu: **Guides** (Ctrl+;) shows or hides them, **Lock Guides** (Alt+Ctrl+;), **Snap to Guides**
  (Shift+Ctrl+;) and **Clear Guides**.
Each document keeps its own guides. Guides are not part of the undo history, as in Photoshop.

**Units** — right-click a ruler (or **View → Ruler Units**) for Pixels, Inches, Centimeters, Millimeters,
Points, Picas, Feet, Meters or Percent. The rulers and the guide read-out count in that unit; the physical
units go through the image's resolution (shown in the menu). **Snap to Unit** makes guides land on the
ruler's small marks, like a grid (Shift does the same for one drag). Both choices are remembered.

**Origin** — drag from the box where the rulers meet to put 0,0 anywhere on the image (it snaps to the
image's edges, centre and guides). Double-click the box, or choose **Reset Ruler Origin (0, 0)** from the
ruler's right-click menu, to put it back on the top-left corner. Each document keeps its own origin.

### Remove Background

The button under the tools, the one with the figure on a checkerboard (also **Image → Remove Background**, **Alt+Ctrl+B**,
or right-click the canvas), makes everything except the subject of the selected layer transparent,
the way remove.bg does. It runs an AI model (IS-Net) on your PC, offline, in a second or two; a small
"working" window shows while it runs. **Image → Remove Background (Fast)** uses a smaller model that
takes a fraction of a second but cuts less precisely.
With a **selection**, only the area inside it is looked at and changed. Draw a marquee around one object
to cut out just that object. It works best on a clear subject (a person, a product, an animal, a car). Fine hair can
still need a touch-up with the Eraser afterwards. **Ctrl+Z** undoes it.

### Layers

Every pasted image, mark, text box and asset is its own layer; nothing is combined until you
save. The **Layers** tab lists them top-most first with a thumbnail, the kind (Image / Text /
Shape), the blend mode and the opacity. Click the eye to hide a layer, double-click the name to
rename it, drag a row to reorder. The row above the list sets the **blend mode** (all of
Photoshop's - Multiply, Screen, Overlay, Soft Light, Difference, Hue, Color, Luminosity…), the
**opacity**, and the **lock**. The buttons under it add, duplicate, delete, reorder and merge
layers and open the **Layer Style** dialog.

**Layer → Layer Style** hangs non-destructive effects on a layer - **Drop Shadow**, **Outer
Glow**, **Stroke** and **Color Overlay** - each with its own colour, size and opacity, previewed
live. A layer with a style shows *fx* in the list; double-click it to edit.

**Layer** menu: New Layer (**Shift+Ctrl+N**), Layer Via Copy / Via Cut (**Ctrl+J** /
**Shift+Ctrl+J** - with a selection, only the selected pixels), Rasterize (text and shapes into
pixels), Arrange (Bring to Front **Shift+Ctrl+]**, Bring Forward **Ctrl+]**, Send Backward
**Ctrl+[**, Send to Back **Shift+Ctrl+[**), Align to Canvas, Merge Down (**Ctrl+E**), Merge
Visible (**Shift+Ctrl+E**), Flatten Image, Lock (**Ctrl+/**), and Save Layer as Asset.

The **History** tab lists every step since the image was opened - fifty of them - and clicking
one jumps straight back (or forward) to it. **Ctrl+Z / Shift+Ctrl+Z** (or **Ctrl+Y**) step one
at a time.

### Selecting

Selections work the way they do in Photoshop: a marching-ants outline, and every tool, filter,
adjustment, fill and delete that follows respects it.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| Rectangular / Elliptical Marquee **(M)** | Drag to select. **Shift** while dragging keeps it square or round, **Alt** draws from the centre. A plain click deselects. **Shift+M** switches shapes. |
| Lasso / Polygonal Lasso **(L)** | Freehand: drag an outline. Polygonal: click each corner; double-click, **Enter** or a click on the first point closes it, **Backspace** removes the last point, **Esc** cancels. |
| Magic Wand **(W)** | Click a colour to select everything like it. *Tolerance*, *Contiguous* and *Sample All Layers* are in the options bar. |

Hold **Shift** before you start to **add** to the selection, **Alt** to **subtract**,
**Shift+Alt** to **intersect** - or pick the mode from the four buttons in the options bar.
*Feather* softens the edge as you make it.

**Select** menu: All (**Ctrl+A**), Deselect (**Ctrl+D**), Reselect (**Shift+Ctrl+D**), Inverse
(**Shift+Ctrl+I**), Layer Pixels (the opaque part of the current layer), Modify → Border /
Smooth / Expand / Contract / Feather (**Shift+F6**), Grow and Similar.

**Reshaping the selection itself.** Right-click the selection (or **Select → Transform
Selection**) and the transform box appears around the marching ants: drag inside to move the
outline, pull the handles to resize it, rotate from just outside a corner, **Ctrl**-drag for
skew, distort and perspective, then **Enter** (or the tick) - the pixels do not move, only the
selected area changes. With a marquee or lasso tool active, dragging *inside* the selection
slides the outline, and the **arrow keys** nudge it.

With a selection on an image layer: **Delete** clears the pixels, **Ctrl+C / Ctrl+X** copy or
cut them (paste comes back as a layer, **Shift+Ctrl+V** pastes in place), **Ctrl+J** lifts
them onto their own layer, **Edit → Fill** (**Shift+F5**) fills them with a colour and a blend
mode, **Edit → Stroke** outlines them, **Image → Crop** cuts the canvas down to them, and
dragging inside the selection with the **Move** tool moves just those pixels.

### Move and Free Transform

**Move (V)** selects a layer by clicking it (Auto-Select) and drags it; **Shift** keeps the
move straight — it follows the nearest axis or 45° diagonal, as far as you have dragged along
it — **Alt**-drag moves a copy, arrows nudge a pixel and **Shift+arrows** ten. The
box around the selected layer is Photoshop's transform box: drag a corner to **scale** (proportional by
default, **Shift** for free, **Alt** about the centre), an edge to stretch, and move the cursor just
outside a corner to **rotate** (**Shift** snaps to 15°). **Ctrl+T** (**Edit → Free Transform**)
enters the full mode: the options bar shows X, Y, W, H, angle and the two skew angles for exact
entry, **Ctrl**-drag an edge handle to **skew**, **Ctrl**-drag a corner to **distort**,
**Ctrl+Alt+Shift**-drag a corner for **perspective** (both warp the pixels on commit), **Enter** or
the tick commits, **Esc** cancels, and right-clicking inside the box switches between Scale,
Rotate, Skew, Distort and Perspective or applies Rotate 180° / 90° and Flip. **Edit → Transform →
Again** (**Shift+Ctrl+T**) repeats the last move/scale/rotate on another layer.

### Painting

The brushes paint into image layers (the **Brush** makes a new transparent layer when none is
selected). All of them share the brush ring cursor, **[** and **]** for size, **Shift+[** and
**Shift+]** for hardness, and the number keys for opacity (**1** = 10% … **0** = 100%).

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| Brush **(B)** | A soft or hard round brush in the foreground colour, with size, hardness, opacity and flow. **Alt**-click picks a colour from the image. Click once, then **Shift**-click somewhere else, and the brush paints a straight line between the two — keep Shift-clicking to chain more. **Shift**-drag locks the stroke horizontal or vertical. Both work for the eraser, clone stamp, blur, sharpen, dodge and burn too. |
| Pencil **(Shift+B)** | A hard-edged freehand stroke that stays its own editable layer; hold **Shift** while drawing for a straight one. |
| Eraser **(E)** | Erases to transparency. |
| Clone Stamp **(S)** | **Alt**-click the source, then paint to copy it - the offset stays aligned across strokes. |
| Gradient **(G)** | Drag from the start to the end: linear or radial, foreground to background (or to transparent), into the selection or the whole layer. |
| Paint Bucket **(Shift+G)** | Fills a colour area with the foreground colour; *Tolerance* and *Contiguous* in the options bar. |
| Blur / Sharpen **(R)** | Paint to soften or sharpen; *Strength* sets how much. Made for hiding names and faces in screenshots. |
| Dodge / Burn **(O)** | Paint to lighten or darken; *Exposure* sets how much. |
| Eyedropper **(I)** | Click to set the foreground colour, **Alt**-click the background; point, 3×3 or 5×5 sample. |

The foreground/background swatches sit under the tool rail: click either to change it, **X**
swaps them, **D** resets to black and white.

### Shapes and text

**Shapes (U)** - Rectangle, Rounded Rectangle (with a corner radius), Ellipse, Polygon (any
number of sides), Line and Arrow, **Shift+U** cycling through them. Drag to draw; **Shift**
keeps proportions or snaps lines to 45°, **Alt** draws from the centre. Stroke colour, width and
fill are in the options bar (right-click a swatch for none), and selecting a shape later brings
its settings back for editing.

**Type (T)**: click the canvas and type; **Ctrl+Enter** or a click away commits, **Esc**
cancels. Font, size, bold/italic/underline, left/centre/right alignment, colour, a background box
and an outline live in the options bar. Click existing text with the Type tool (or double-click
it with Move) to edit it again. Text rotates, skews and mirrors like any layer, and a distort or
perspective transform turns it into pixels first.

### Crop and canvas

**Crop (C)**: drag the crop, then adjust its handles or drag inside to move it; the options bar
offers ratio presets (1:1, 4:3, 16:9, 3:2, original) and *Delete Cropped Pixels*. **Enter** or
the tick applies, **Esc** cancels. **Image → Crop** crops to the selection, **Trim** drops the
transparent border, **Reveal All** grows the canvas to show every layer. **Image Size**
(**Alt+Ctrl+I**) scales the whole composition, **Canvas Size** (**Alt+Ctrl+C**) adds or removes
room around it with an anchor, and **Image Rotation** turns or flips the whole canvas.

### Adjustments and filters

**Image → Adjustments** work on the selected image layer (text and shapes offer to become pixels
first) and, with a selection, only inside it; every dialog previews live on the canvas with a
*Preview* toggle and a *Reset* button: **Brightness/Contrast**, **Levels** (**Ctrl+L**, with a
histogram and draggable black/grey/white points), **Curves** (**Ctrl+M**, click to add points and
drag them, per channel), **Exposure**, **Vibrance**, **Hue/Saturation** (**Ctrl+U**, with
Colorize), **Color Balance** (**Ctrl+B**), **Black & White** (**Alt+Shift+Ctrl+B**, per-colour
weights and a tint), **Photo Filter**, **Invert** (**Ctrl+I**), **Posterize**, **Threshold**,
**Desaturate** (**Shift+Ctrl+U**) and **Equalize**, plus **Auto Tone** (**Shift+Ctrl+L**),
**Auto Contrast** (**Alt+Shift+Ctrl+L**) and **Auto Color** (**Shift+Ctrl+B**).

**Filter**: Blur → Gaussian, Motion, Box; Sharpen → Sharpen, Sharpen More, Unsharp Mask; Noise
→ Add Noise, Median, Reduce Noise; Pixelate → Mosaic; Stylize → Emboss, Find Edges, Solarize;
Other → High Pass, Vignette. **Last Filter** (**Alt+Ctrl+F**) runs the previous one again.

### View

The wheel zooms, **Ctrl+0** fits, **Ctrl+1** is 100%, **Ctrl++ / Ctrl+-** step, the **Zoom
(Z)** tool clicks in (**Alt** out) or drags a box to zoom to, and the **Hand (H)** tool - or
holding **Space** - pans. The zoom box in the status bar takes a typed percentage. **Ctrl+R**
shows rulers in pixels, **Ctrl+H** hides the selection edges and transform box while you look.

### The asset library

The bottom-right panel keeps logos, stamps and any PNG/JPG/vector (WMF/EMF) art you reuse,
organised as categories and sub-categories. **＋ Folder** makes a category under the selected
one, **＋ Import** copies image files in, and double-clicking an asset drops it onto the canvas
as a new layer. **Layer → Save Layer as Asset** goes the other way - it renders the selected
layer alone and stores it in the current category.

It is all plain files under `%AppData%\MicroApp\Assets` - one folder per category - so you can
also fill it straight from Explorer.

### Getting the picture out

- **File → Save As** (**Ctrl+S**) - PNG keeps transparency, JPG (over white) for mail, BMP or TIFF.
- **Shift+Ctrl+C** (Copy Merged) - puts the flattened result, or just the selected part of it,
  straight back on the clipboard.

## Shortcuts

Tray → **Shortcuts** shows every hot key in one window — typing, OCR, Pick Text, Always on Top, capture, GIF,
video, notes, the image editor and the two typed dates. The rows edit the very same settings the
individual feature windows do, so the two always agree: change a hot key here and the feature's
own settings window shows the new value; change it there and this window shows it. Saving warns
if two actions ended up on the same combination, and an empty key box disables that hot key.

**Typed dates**: **Ctrl+Shift+D** types today's date and **Ctrl+Shift+M** the long form into
whatever window has focus, using the same typing engine as the clipboard paste — so they work in
the same places, VM consoles included. Both formats are edited on this window with a live
preview; they are the same formats the note toolbar's date buttons use.

Both AI keys are stored in your own user settings file (see *Where files go*) and are never included
in the installer or the portable download. Switching provider fills in that provider's usual model
name; the base URL box only applies to MiMo.

#### Sync

**Sync is optional and off until you turn it on.** Out of the box notes are ordinary `.txt` files in a
folder on this PC and nothing leaves it — that mode is fully supported and needs no account, no
network and no setup. Everything below only applies if you want the same notes on more than one PC.

If you do, the database is **a Firebase project you create and own** — nothing ships with the app, and
the notes never pass through anyone else's account. **Set up sync** in Note Setting opens a wizard
whose first page includes *Just this PC*, so staying local is a choice you can make (or come back to)
rather than the absence of one. There is no address or password to invent: MicroApp makes its own
sign-in inside your project.

**On the first PC** the wizard walks through making the project. It is free (Firebase Spark plan, no
card):

1. Create a project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Build → Firestore Database → Create database (Standard, Native mode, a region near you).
3. Rules tab → paste the rules from the wizard (**Copy rules**) → Publish.
4. Build → Authentication → Get started → Email/Password → Enable.
5. Project settings → General → Your apps → Web app. The snippet holds `projectId` and `apiKey`.
6. Put those two into the wizard and press **Create and connect**.

It then shows a **sync code**. **On every other PC**, run the wizard, choose *I have a sync code*,
paste it, and that is the whole setup — the code carries the project, the key and the sign-in.

Anyone holding the code can read the notes, so pass it across the way you would a password. Note
Setting shows it again later under **Sync code**.

**Going back to local-only** at any time: **Disconnect** in Note Setting (or *Just this PC* in the
wizard). The notes already on the PC stay exactly where they are and keep working as plain files; the
copies in your database stay there too until you delete them yourself.

The `.txt` files on disk stay the source of truth, so notes work with no network. A sync runs a few
seconds after a change, and each PC checks the others every 15 seconds — cheaply, by reading one small
marker document and only fetching the notes when it says something changed. The newer copy of a note
wins, judged on the database's clock rather than each PC's, and a note deleted on one PC is deleted on
the others. Pins, colours, archive flags and the manual order travel with the notes. `.sync-log` in the Notes folder records the last 60 syncs
if something looks wrong.

Clearing a hot key's key box (Delete or Backspace) disables that hot key.

### When another app already owns the hot key

Global hot keys are first-come-first-served: whichever app registered the combination first keeps it.
When MicroApp finds one taken it asks

> **Ctrl + Alt + V is already registered by another application.**
> Use it for MicroApp instead? MicroApp will see the key first, and the other app will stop receiving it.

Answer **Yes, use it here** and MicroApp takes the combination over — it watches the keyboard directly,
acts on the key, and swallows it, so the app holding the registration no longer sees it. **Leave it**
leaves that MicroApp hot key switched off; the tray menu still works, and you can pick a different key
in the settings window.

The answer is remembered for that exact combination, so you are asked once, not at every start. Change
the key and the next conflict asks again. If the other app is closed later, MicroApp goes back to a
normal registration on its own.

Two things a take-over cannot do: combinations Windows reserves for itself (`Ctrl+Alt+Del`, `Win+L`,
`Win+Shift+S`) never reach any application, and an unsigned build outside `C:\Program Files` cannot
take a key while a UAC-elevated window has the focus.

## Starting with Windows

The installer's last page has a **Run MicroApp when Windows starts** checkbox, ticked by default. It
creates a MicroApp shortcut in the Startup folder — for all users when you use the standard installer,
for you alone with the per-user one.

To change your mind later, without reinstalling:

- **Turn it on** — press `Win+R`, type `shell:startup`, and drop a shortcut to `MicroApp.exe` in the
  folder that opens.
- **Turn it off** — delete the MicroApp shortcut from that folder. `shell:common startup` is the
  all-users equivalent.
- Task Manager's **Startup apps** tab can also disable it without deleting anything.

Uninstalling removes the shortcut either way.

## Where files go

- **Screenshots** — `Pictures\MicroApp\MicroApp-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.png`, or the folder you set in Capture Setting.
- **GIFs** — `MicroApp-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.gif` in the GIF folder; if that is blank, the image folder is used.
- **Videos** — `MicroApp-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.mp4` in `Videos\MicroApp`, or the folder you set in Video Setting.
- **Notes** — `Note-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt` in a `Notes` folder next to `MicroApp.exe` when that is
  writable (portable use), otherwise under `%AppData%\MicroApp\Notes`. Pins, archive flags, colours
  and the manual order sit beside them in `.notes-meta`; sync keeps `.sync-log` and `.notes-deleted`
  in the same folder.
- **Editor assets** — the image editor's logo/stamp library lives under `%AppData%\MicroApp\Assets`,
  one folder per category. Copying files there in Explorer works just as well as the Import button.
- **The app itself** — `C:\Program Files\MicroApp` (standard installer),
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\MicroApp` (per-user installer), or wherever you unzipped the portable build.
- **Your settings** — the standard per-user .NET settings file under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MicroApp\...\user.config`. Uninstalling the app does not delete it.

## Troubleshooting

**The app won't start: "A referral was returned from the server."**
The build has `uiAccess="true"` in its manifest, which Windows only allows for a signed binary running
from `C:\Program Files`. Either install it there and sign it, or build with `uiAccess="false"` (the
default in this repository), which works everywhere except UAC-elevated windows.

**Nothing happens when I press a hot key.**
Another app already owns that combination — global hot keys are first-come-first-served. MicroApp
offers to take it over when it finds one taken (see *When another app already owns the hot key*); if
you answered **Leave it**, that hot key stays off until you pick a different key in the matching
settings window. Note that Windows itself reserves some combinations (for example `Win+Shift+S`) and
those cannot be taken over by anything.

**Typing skips or duplicates characters.**
Raise *milliseconds between keystrokes* in Typing Setting, and try the `SendInput` method. Remote desktops
and VM consoles usually need 15–30 ms.

**Nothing is typed into an admin window.**
A normal-privilege app cannot send input to an elevated one. Run MicroApp elevated too, or use the
signed + Program Files route described above.

**OCR says "No text found in that selection."**
The text may be too small or too low-contrast. Zoom in first, or select a tighter area. Very light text
on a busy background is the usual failure case.

**The language list is empty / OCR fails immediately.**
Windows has no OCR language pack installed. Add one under *Time & language → Language & region*.

**"Clipboard is busy."**
Another app is holding the clipboard open. MicroApp retries for a moment, then tells you. Try again.

**Bangla typing shows no suggestions.**
Notes needs a string.bd API token — set it in Note Setting. If the token is there, check that the
machine can reach `string.bd`; MicroApp never blocks your typing on a lookup, so a failed one simply
leaves the word as you typed it.

**The Grammar button, Ask AI or a Bangla→English translation reports an error.**
The message comes straight from the AI provider. The usual causes are an empty or wrong API key, a
model name that provider does not serve, or no credit left on the account. MiMo Token Plan keys
(`tp-…`) also need the regional base URL from the MiMo console.

**The GIF is huge.**
Lower the frame rate, shorten the recording, or select a smaller area. GIF has no interframe
compression to speak of — file size scales with area × frames.

**A second copy won't start.**
By design: one instance at a time. If no window and no tray icon are visible, check Task Manager for a
stale `MicroApp.exe` and end it.
